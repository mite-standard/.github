# Governance

The goal of the Minimum Information about a Tailoring Enzyme (MITE) data standard and repository is to facilitate community-driven curation of natural product-acting tailoring enzyme information.
Discussion on this governance model is taking place in the MITE Standard [Discussions Page](https://github.com/orgs/mite-standard/discussions/4).
This document is inspired by the [Bioregistry Governance model](https://github.com/biopragmatics/bioregistry/blob/main/docs/GOVERNANCE.md).

## Governing Body

The MITE Governing Body oversees the maintenance and development of the MITE data standard and repository.

Its key responsibilities include:

- Managing the rolling release model and ensuring monthly updates to the MITE data repository and web portal.
- Maintaining the availability and functionality of the web portal.
- Reviewing and approving proposed changes to the [MITE Data Standard Schema](https://github.com/orgs/mite-standard/discussions/3) by majority vote.

### Membership

- Membership to the Governing Body is requested by contacting one of its members.
- Membership is granted at the discretion of the existing MITE Governing Body through a majority vote.
- Members must join and participate in the [MIBiG Slack](https://mibigannotathons.slack.com/).
- Members must be listed alphabetically by last name [below](#members).

#### Member Onboarding

New members of the MITE Governing Body will:

- Be invited to the private channel on [MIBiG Slack](https://mibigannotathons.slack.com/).
- Be granted access to the MITE Standard Organization on GitHub.
- Be listed below in alphabetical order by last name, along with their GitHub handle, ORCID identifier, and date of joining.

## MITE Reviewers

MITE Reviewers are responsible for evaluating user submissions to the [MITE Data Repository](https://github.com/mite-standard/mite_data). 
They review new entries and modifications to existing entries based on the criteria outlined in the [MITE Data Wiki](https://github.com/mite-standard/mite_data/wiki/How-to-Review-Entries).

Reviewers may propose rejecting new or modified entries if they:

- Fall outside the scope of MITE.
- For new entries, are a duplicate of an already existing entry (~=identical UniProt ID)
- Lack experimental evidence.
- Contain factual inaccuracies that cannot be reasonably corrected.
- Violate community guidelines or the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

### Membership

- To become a MITE Reviewer, individuals must contact a Governing Body member.
- New members must complete onboarding training with a Governing Body member.
- Members must join and participate in the [MIBiG Slack](https://mibigannotathons.slack.com/).

#### Member Onboarding

New reviewers will:

- Be added to the private channel on [MIBiG Slack](https://mibigannotathons.slack.com/).
- Complete onboarding training.
- Be granted access to the MITE Standard Organization on GitHub.

#### Removing Members

- Members may request removal at any time.
- Members who violate the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) may be proposed for removal by a Governing Body or Review team member.

## Publications / Attribution

- All members of the Governing Body are automatically listed as authors on MITE-related publications.
- Reviewers who have actively participated in reviewing submissions since the previous publication are invited to be co-authors.
- All data contributors, regardless of the size of their contributions, are invited to be co-authors on MITE publications.
- Authorship eligibility is based on ORCID-linked contributions to entries submitted or modified since the last publication.
- Anonymous contributors (i.e., those who did not provide an ORCID) are not eligible for co-authorship.

## Bootstrapping governance

This governance model takes effect on March 1, 2025.

## Updating governance

Governance updates follow this process:

1. Propose changes in the MITE Standard Discussion Page [Governance Mega-Thread](https://github.com/orgs/mite-standard/discussions/4)
2. Engage potential stakeholders in discussion.
3. Solicit a review from the MITE Governing Body.
4. Approval: The Governing Body will review and accept changes at its discretion.

This process does not apply to minor edits (e.g., formatting, grammar, or structural improvements), which may be made ad hoc.
The MITE Governing Body may also unilaterally modify this document and will announce any changes on the MITE Standard Discussion Page.
